    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Like all the functions we use, the function is a self contained thing. It takes in values as paramaters when called, and produces a return value. All of the inputs that may change should be in that function call, imagine your function being cut/pasted into some other file - it should not depend on anything outside of libraries that it may need. \n",
    "<li>Test your function with more than one function call, with different inputs. See an example in comments below the first question. \n",
    "<li>If something doesn't work, print or look at the varaibles window. The #1 skill that'll allow you to write usable code is the ability to find and fix errors. Printing a value out line by line so you can see how it changes, and looking for the step where something goes wrong is A-OK and pretty normal. It is boring. \n",

    "You may notice there's no data specified or attached. You'll need to generate some test data if you want to test your functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to generate test data is to use some of the random functions to generate data that looks like what you need. Numpy random and scipy disributions .rvs functions are good places to look, we've also generated random data many times in the past. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no specific requirement on what your data needs to be, it just needs to be good enough to test your function. If you pay attention to what exactly you're calculating and the criteria given, you should be able to create some suitable data for different tests. As an example, for the Hyp Test question, you need two sets of normal data. You can generate some in many ways, one is through scipy:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>ss.norm.rvs(loc=0, scale=1, size=1, random_state=None)\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Since you're checking if there's a significant difference between the two groups, you'd likely want multiple sets of data - two that are very close, so they will not show a difference, and two that are not close, so they will show a difference. Think about what you are checking, then just make some data that will allow you to test that. \n",
    "\n",
    "This should not be extremely difficult to code nor should it be super time consuming, the commands are pretty simple and generating random varaibles is pretty similar for any distribution. There is some though involved in saying \"what data do I need to check this?\" That's something that is pretty important in general, if we are creating something we need to make sure that it works in general, not just one example. Critically, there are not specific sets of data you need - almost anything will work. It is only there to let your functions run and see if they are correct. You don't need to aim for \"the perfect test data\" or anything like that, just make some data in a list, if it needs to be of a certain distribution, use that dist to get it; if the distribution doesn't matter, just make something.
